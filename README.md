# Github Compare
Github compare is a web based project which helps you to compare your Github stats with other users who are registered on Github. It returns followers count, following count, repo count and much more information. If you stats are less as compared to your opponent's stats then it will show your stats in red color and your opponent's stats in green color for better understanding and easy visuals.
